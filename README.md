# ProNet
<<<<<<< HEAD
ProNet is a minimal yet professional client-server application built in modern C++ using Winsock and CMake. It enables structured peer-to-peer message exchange using JSON (via json.hpp) without relying on third-party libraries like Boost. It's designed to showcase clean architecture, real-time communication, and professional code organization in a native Windows environment.

# Professional Networking App (Client-Server Model)

A lightweight C++ client-server networking application built using the Winsock API on Windows. This project demonstrates the networking fundamentals, socket programming, and clean software design principles. The app simulates a basic professional networking platform where users can connect and exchange messages.

## 💼 Purpose

This project is designed to showcase:
- Understanding of TCP socket communication using Winsock.
- Clean separation of concerns between client and server logic.
- Well-structured code with modern C++ practices.
- Readable, documented code with proper error handling.

It can be extended to support multiple clients, user registration, or even integrate a database in the future.

## 🚀 Features

✅ TCP connection between a client and server  
✅ Modular code with `.cpp` and `.h` separation  
✅ Basic message exchange functionality  
✅ Winsock initialization and teardown  
✅ Easily extensible architecture
