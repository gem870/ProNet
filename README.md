# ProNet
ProNet is a minimal yet professional client-server application built in modern C++ using Winsock and CMake. It enables structured peer-to-peer message exchange using JSON (via json.hpp) without relying on third-party libraries like Boost. It's designed to showcase clean architecture, real-time communication, and professional code organization in a native Windows environment.
